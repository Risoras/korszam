The task was to write a program that numerically integrates cos(x)*exp(-x^2).

I worte the cos(x)*exp(-x^2) function first (called "cosexp") then created the function to integrate it ("integral").

"Integral" is fairly simple, takes two arguments, the upper on lower bounds of the definite integral. 
It then takes the length of the interval "interval" and divides it by 10^6, which is then rounded to obtain N, number of steps the integration will take.
"L" is then divided by N to obtain "dx", the length of each step.
Then a simple for loop using the trapezoidal rule does the integration.
