The task was to write a program that numerically integrates.

I first worte a function "cosexp" is the following function: cos(x)*exp(-x^2), then created the function "integral" that can numerically integrate any function passed to it.

"Integral" is fairly simple, takes four arguments, the upper on lower bounds of the definite integral as "long double" numbers, 
the function we want to integrate and a "p" variable that will determine how accurate the integration will be (it's value is 10^-6 by default).
It then takes the length of the interval, "L" and divides it by "p"", which is then rounded to obtain N, the number of steps the integration will take.
"L" is then divided by N to obtain "dx", the length of each step.
Then a simple for loop using the trapezoidal rule does the integration.
Finally the function returns the result as a long double.
